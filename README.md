## React + Typescript + vite + chakra UI

## Set up 

  ```bash
     npm i 
  ```

## Run 

  ```bash
      npm run dev
  ```

## Test

  ```bash
    npm run test
 ```

## Considerations

Had a lot of fun doing it! 
Some of the most obvious improvements I would make would be 

- More testing! 
- Component library where the libraries used live (chakra ui)
- More sophisticated validation using something like Zod
- Add sorting filtering etc to tables (would use table headless UI library)
- Cooler UI ... LOL
